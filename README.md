To run iOS app you also need to install Swift project's dependencies:

```

Before running you must:

* Add firebase files: 
    * For Android: `google-services.json` into directory `./android/app/`
    * For iOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist` into directory `./ios/`
    
* Create .env file in root directory. Check the .env.example file for template.

## Running the app

You can launch the Android app in two variants - production (mainnet) and beta (testnet):

```sh
$ npm run android:prod
$ npm run android:beta
```

To run iOS app:

```sh
$ npm run ios
```

In general, the React packager/server should be started automatically after running the app. However, if it didn't happen for some reasons you must do it yourself:

```sh
$ npm start
```

```sh
$ npm run test
```
